### Interests

To edit, you can add new titles by putting the `##` before them, you can make text bold by surrounding with `**`, you can make links by doing [Link Name](http://example.com). Just make sure to save the `style.css` file in the same folder as this markdown file & you should be good to go. HAPPY CVing!
